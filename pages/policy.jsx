          <p>
            THEALIENSTORE uses cookies in a range of ways to improve your experience on our website and
            application, including without limitation to:
            Report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use our website and application;
            Understand overall visitor behavior;
          </p>

            There are a number of different types of cookies our website and application uses, including
            without limitation:
            Strictly Necessary Cookies - Most websites, including ours, would not work very well without
            certain cookies. They allow us to prevent crashes, display information, fix bugs, and ensure the
            security of our website and application (and your account). These types of cookies are often called
            “strictly necessary” cookies. Because they are needed for our website and application to work, we
            do not provide you with an ability to opt-out of these cookies. But you can remove them by using
            your browser settings. Keep in mind that certain features of our website and application may not
            be available to you.
          </p>
          Functionality Cookies - THEALIENSTORE uses these cookies so that we recognize you on our
          website and application and remember your previously selected preferences. For example, if you
          have added items into your Shopping Cart and closed the session without completing the purchase
          and without eliminating those items, these cookies allow you to continue the shopping experience
          the next time you access our website (within a limited period), finding the same products that
          were selected. Functional cookies are not essential to the functioning of the website, but rather
          improve navigation quality and experience.
          Statistics Cookies - Also known as “performance cookies,” these cookies collect information about
          how you use a website and application, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked
          on. None of this information can be used to identify you. It is all aggregated and, therefore,
          anonymized. Their sole purpose is to improve website and application functions. This includes
          cookies from our third party analytics services.
          Marketing Cookies - These cookies track your online activity to help our third party service
          providers deliver more relevant advertising or to limit how many times you see an ad. These
          cookies allow you to be provided with our commercial offering on other websites not operated by
          THEALIENSTORE. Our third party service providers uses these cookies to collect information about
          your visit to our website and application, the content you viewed, the links you followed and
          information about your browser, device, and your IP address. With third party cookies we do not
          have control of the information provided by the cookie and we do not have access to this data.
          This information is entirely controlled by third party cookies as described in their respective policy.
          To find out more about the aforementioned third parties’ cookie, you can inform yourself on their
          respective polices and knowingly manage your consent or refusal, for this we invite you to visit
          http://youronlinechoices.com.
          Security and Storage. We believe our website and application incorporate safeguards to protect
          the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy, and privacy of the personal information we have
          collected. We have put in place reasonable precautions to protect information from loss, misuse,
          and alteration. However, despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measures are
          perfect or impenetrable and we cannot guarantee that the information you transmit or provide to
          us will be completely secure.
          <p>
            We will retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide you with our services
            (e.g., as long as you have an online account with us) or as needed to fulfill our own obligations,
            such as preventing fraud, meeting regulatory requirements, resolving disputes, improving our
            services or maintaining security, and in each case, as consistent with applicable law. We may
            retain non-personal information that has been sufficiently aggregated or anonymized for a longer
            period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Policy Changes. THEALIENSTORE may at any time amend the provisions in this Privacy Policy.

            the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of our emails. You may continue to
            receive service-related and other non-marketing emails (e.g., confirmation emails regarding your
            online orders or RSVP to one of our pop-up events).</p>
          <p>
            Cookies - Most browsers let you remove and/or stop accepting cookies from the websites you
            visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Note that disabling cookies
            and/or other tracking tools may prevent THEALIENSTORE or its service providers from providing
            you certain features of our website and application.
            Advertising Choices - Your device settings may provide functionality to limit use of advertising ID
            associated with your device for interest-based advertising purposes. Additionally, you can manage
            third party advertising preferences for some of the third parties we work with that serve
            advertising across the internet by using the choices available at
            http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and www.aboutads.info/choices. We
            do not guarantee that all of the third parties we work with will honor the elections you make using
            those options, but we strive to work with third parties that do.

          <p>
            Privacy Settings and Location Data - Users of our website and application can disable our access to

            Choosing Not to Share Your Personal Information - If you do not provide information that we need
            to provide you with our products and services, we may not be able to provide you with such
            products and service or provide you access to certain features of our websites, applications,
            stores, or pop-up events. For example, if you do not provide us with your name to RSVP at our
            pop-up events, we will not be able to add you to our guest list to allow you entrance at our event.
            Third Party Platforms or Social Media Networks - We encourage you to review your privacy
            options and settings of third party platforms that you use in connection with our websites,
            products, services and events, including without limitation social media platforms and networks.

          </p>
          <p>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
            we collected personal information or an authorized representative. Such verification process will
            involve you confirming at least three pieces of personal information we have collected about you,
            and will increase in scope in the event the nature of your request relates to the disclosure of
            sensitive personal information or the deletion of any personal information;
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
            respond to it; and</p>
          <p>Include a statement that you “declare under penalty of perjury that you are the person about
            whom the Right to Know/Delete request has been made.”
            Right to Appoint an Authorized Agent - You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to
            submit the above requests on your behalf. For an authorized agent to be verified, you must
            provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of
            attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity according to the above method
            before processing the authorized agent’s request.
            Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights - You may exercise
            your rights under the CCPA without discrimination. However, if you choose not to provide us with
            certain information, you may not be eligible to receive certain promotions and offers for our
            products and services (e.g., if you do not sign up for our newsletters, you may not benefit from
            receiving notifications of discounts or free shipping to customers that may be exclusively offered
            to our subscribers).</p>
          <p>Additional Disclosures Related to Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information - Sections
            1 through 4 of this Privacy Policy describe the categories of personal information we collect,
            categories of sources of personal information that we collect from, the business or commercial
            purpose for collection, and categories of third parties we disclose information to.
            Sale of Personal Data - We do not believe that we sell your personal information as defined under
            the CCPA and we will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity
            to opt-out of such sale as required by law.</p>
          <p>Direct Marketing and Do Not Track Signals - Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California
            residents may request and obtain a notice once a year about the personal information we shared
            with other businesses for their own direct marketing purposes. Such a notice will include a list of
            the categories of personal information that were shared (if any) and the names and addresses of
            all third parties with which the personal information was shared (if any). The notice will cover the
            preceding calendar year. To obtain such a notice, please contact us as described below. In
            addition, under this law you are entitled to be advised how we handle “Do Not Track” browser
            signals. THEALIENSTORE does not personally track its users over time and across third party
            websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT)
            signals. However, some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they
            serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such
            websites, most web browsers (like Safari) allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so third
            parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.</p>

            Nevada Residents: Your Nevada Privacy Rights. Nevada law (SB 220) requires website operators to
            provide a way for Nevada consumers to opt-out of the sale of certain information that the website
            operator may collect about them. THEALIENSTORE does not sell your personal information to third
            parties as defined in Nevada law, and will not do so without providing you with notice and an

            data privacy practices or our compliance with Nevada data privacy law, please contact us via the
